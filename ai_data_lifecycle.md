## AI Data Flow in India's Public Generative AI

### Purpose of the Lifecycle Model

A sequence begins when information enters public generative AI platforms across India, tracing movement until erasure or system shutdown. Regulatory alignment shapes each phase, allowing structured identification of national compliance duties alongside potential data threats and oversight measures.

With every query, public generative models absorb new inputs while producing outputs - making oversight an ongoing task. Instead of concluding once launched, accountability stretches across active usage.

### Stage 1: Data Collection Begins

**Description**

Whenever someone types a prompt, uploads a file, or leaves feedback on a public generative AI platform, that interaction becomes part of the gathered records. Information shared during these moments might contain private details, legally protected material, intimate identifiers, or proprietary knowledge - sometimes given knowingly, at times without awareness. Despite intent, once entered, such content enters automated processing streams.

**Data Types**

-   User prompts and messages
-   Uploaded content (text, documents, images)
-   Information like when actions occur, internet locations, or unique hardware tags helps track digital activity across systems without revealing actual content shared during exchanges
-   Interaction logs

**Primary Actors**

-   AI system deployer (Data Fiduciary under DPDP)
-   End users (Data Principals)

**Governance Relevance**

At this point, key duties arise under India’s data rules - processing must follow clear purposes, rely on permission or valid grounds, inform individuals properly, while avoiding unnecessary data gathering through protective measures.

### Stage 2: Labeling and cleaning data

**Description**

Not every piece of gathered interaction data moves forward unchanged - some gets cleaned, stripped of identifiers, tagged, or reshaped. Depending on the goal, adjustments support reliability, safer outputs, insight extraction, or upgrades down the line. Who manages it? Sometimes internal teams, sometimes outside specialists take charge.

**Data Types**

-   Annotated prompts and responses
-   Filtered or categorized datasets
-   Derived datasets created through preprocessing

**Primary Actors**

-   AI developer
-   Computing handlers or outside suppliers

**Governance Relevance**

Despite good intentions, labeling can lead to unintended exposure when data is traced back to individuals. Bias might grow quietly over time, shaped by how information gets framed at the start. Uses may drift far from what people first agreed to share. Rules need grounding in initial permissions, clear agreements, not just broad ideals. Limits on scope should be active, not assumed. Decisions rest better on constraints built early, followed with care.

### Stage 3: Model training and fine tuning

**Description**

Though preprocessed data serves multiple purposes - like guiding model updates through labeled examples - it also supports methods that adjust behavior via feedback signals. Some models improve over time by revisiting past interactions, where lessons emerge from repeated exposure to real usage patterns.

**Data Types**

-   Training datasets
-   Model parameters and embeddings
-   Derived representations

**Primary Actors**

-   AI developer
-   People who design models work alongside those testing them

**Governance Relevance**

With every step forward comes the chance of copying too closely, using protected material without permission, or reusing private details improperly. At this moment, building in privacy protections early matters most - alongside clear rules for ownership and systems that track responsibility. Though often overlooked, how choices are made here shapes what follows.

### Stage 4: Deployment and User Interaction

**Description**

When users interact, the machine responds instantly with tailored results. Depending on context, responses might include original wording, condensed versions, suggestions, or artificially produced material.

**Data Types**

-   Generated responses
-   Moderation flags
-   Safety logs

**Primary Actors**

-   AI deployer
-   End users

**Governance Relevance**

A deployment might release damaging content, spread false information, generate deceptive media, or lead to unintended data exploitation. Clear oversight, protective measures for generated material, systems to address user concerns, along with traceable decision paths, form essential parts of responsible management.

### Stage 5:  Decommissioning, Retention, and Deletion

**Description**

When required by law, data stays stored - sometimes to check performance, sometimes to refine tools. Yet removal happens if users ask, when rules say so, or once systems turn off.

**Data Types**

-   Archived logs
-   Model snapshots
-   Audit records

**Primary Actors**

-   AI deployer
-   Compliance and legal teams

**Governance Relevance**

When data stays longer than needed, it triggers liability under India's privacy rules. Responsibility falls on handlers to delete when required. Holding information without cause can lead to lasting consequences - legal exposure grows, trust fades. Following limits isn’t optional; proof of compliance matters just as much. Failure leaves room for scrutiny years later.

### How This Cycle Affects AI Rules in India

This lifecycle model provides the structural foundation for:

-   Mapping DPDP Act obligations to concrete system stages
-   Identifying data-specific risks unique to generative AI
-   Designing enforceable governance controls
-   Drafting policy-grade implementation frameworks

This framework shapes every later stage of the work here. What follows depends entirely on how these phases unfold.
