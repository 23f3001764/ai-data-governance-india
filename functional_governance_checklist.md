# Functional Governance Checklist for Generative AI Systems (India)

## Purpose of the Checklist

A set of practical steps turns broad oversight rules into clear actions for teams creating or launching public generative AI tools across India. Built to support real-world adherence, it links organizational work directly to requirements found in the DPDP Act, IT Act, and Copyright Act by showing how they apply on the ground.

A review tool organized around phases of AI development serves purposes like internal evaluation, oversight checks, or preparation for regulatory alignment. Though built for one workflow, its layout adapts easily to different verification needs across teams.

## How to Use This Checklist

- Developers can use this checklist during system design and training
Built-in checks support routine oversight during deployment cycles. Oversight tasks gain clarity when teams apply standardized review patterns. During audits, evidence collection follows established workflows. Compliance tracking improves through consistent execution methods. Review phases benefit from structured validation steps. Systematic approaches reduce gaps in operational assessments.

- Policymakers can use it as a reference for practical AI governance expectations
This checklist marks a starting point for sound AI data oversight in India. When filled out fully, it shows minimum preparedness has been met. Its structure guides users through key steps without assuming prior expertise. Filling each item thoughtfully reflects an understanding of local needs. The process supports better decisions around fairness and access. Each section builds awareness gradually. Done right, it helps avoid common missteps tied to bias or exclusion. Progress here signals commitment more than perfection.

Completion of this checklist indicates **baseline readiness for responsible AI data governance in the Indian context**.
